# Quiz App

Hey folks! I'm still learning Swift and I made a simple app again. This time, unlike the others, I wrote this using MVC. 
I also learned how to write a struct while writing this. Its design is quite simple. There are questions on the screen and 
when you answer them correctly, the score counter counts your score. When you click on the buttons, if the button you click 
is the correct answer, the button turns green.

The app works exactly like this. ðŸ‘‡

That's how it is.
